# Steganography
A steganograph written in C#. It hides useful information inside lots of useless information. 

The usage is pretty self-explanatory, and it's pretty optimized so it shouldn't have trouble
running on any system. 

Technically, it could allow for a much bigger message length because I only used the R property
of the image pixels, and maybe I'll do that in the future, but for now, this will do.
